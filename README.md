# work-day-scheduler

## Description

### Motivation

Keep busy employees organized so they can schedule and view important events during their work day as well as upcoming and pass events.

### Why?

Helps employees with a busy schedule manage time effectively.

### Problem Solved

Users can add important events and be sure not to double book or be late.

### Learnings

I learned how to create a calender with time slots and text area and to store events so that if the browser was refreshed my schedule is saved using local storage. I'm learning to do cleaner code so it's easier to read and work with. I find writing to-do comments helps me stay organized and on track. Also having more constant values is also cleaner and safer. I was able to practise using JSON and dayjs.
